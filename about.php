    <h2>What is the Adirondack Forty-Sixers, Inc.?</h2>
    <p>The Adirondack Forty-Sixers, Inc. is a membership organization that recognizes those who have climbed the 46 High Peaks in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York State with an elevation of 4,000 feet or higher. The mountain elevations are based on the figures listed in Russell M. L. Carson’s book Peaks and People of the Adirondacks that was published in 1927. While subsequent geological surveys have indicated that four of the peaks are less than 4,000 feel, the club uses the original measurements as the basis for membership.
       In addition to registering those who have climbed the 46 High Peaks, the club’s mission is to education the public on responsible wilderness use and to encourage stewardship in the High Peaks region. We sponsor programs to promote safe hiking and the preservation of the wilderness so hikers will be able to enjoy the region for generations to come.
       The Adirondack Forty-Sixers is not part of the Adirondack Mountain Club. Many climbers choose to become members of both organizations.
