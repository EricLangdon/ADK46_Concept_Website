The most popular route to the top of Macomb Mountain is from the Elk Lake Trail at the first lean-to camping site.  Follow Slide Brook to the base of either one of the two slides that leads to points just below the summit ridge. Rumor has it that there is a delicious blueberry crop on the trail of the Macomb Mountain. Yum!"

The normal route to Emmons follows the same approach to the other Seward Range Mountains.  This approach is from the west and there will be many lean-tos that are found along the Ward Brook Truck Trail. The unmarked trail to Seward Range begins about .2 miles south east of the spot where the trail for Coreys joins the fire truck trail.  Past the bridge, there should be a wall of Seward.  Follow it to the left until you climb up and over to the summit ridge.  It is then about a 15 minute walk up to the summit.  From the summit of Seward, there will be a well-defined heard-path descending to the south flanks of the western Seward Ridge and then follows a compass line from both peaks across the ridge until the summit of Donaldson is reached. After you reach Donaldson, another heard-path forms down to the west side of the ridge between the two mountains until you start to climb the ridge near the top of Emmons. The trail to Emmons is very enjoyable with open views of Emmons to the front and Donaldson to the rear. At the summit of Emmons there are great views of all the other High Peaks and a glimpse of the Santanoni Range."

Hudowalski was just the 9th person to successfully summit all 46 High Peaks (thereby joining the Adirondack 46ers Club), and was the first woman to complete the feat. The name change was the result of a 12-year effort by the 46ers and other groups who were adamant that Hudowalski, a lifelong activist in the Adirondack Park, deserved a namesake. The most popular route is from the Elk Lake Trailhead, following the trail to Slide Brook lean-to. From here, the heard path follows Slide Brook upstream to the slides of Macomb Mountain. Follow the slide to the summit of Macomb and then follow the ridge first to South Dix and then on to Grace Peak. "

It is not recommended for children or inexperienced hikers. Cliff Mountain is part of the Marcy Group of the Great Range. It is flanked to the southeast by Mount Redfield, and the two can be scaled in combination. There are multiple routes up Cliff Mountain, one of which begins at the Upper Works/Calamity Brook trailhead on Upper Works Road in Newcomb. Follow the Calamity Brook Trail for 4.5 miles before continuing around Flowed Lands and crossing the Lake Colden Bridge. Upon reaching the Uphill Lean-to, you'll see a small cairn that indicates the herd path to the summits of Cliff Mountain (to the right) and Mount Redfield (straight/to the left). The herd path splits a short distance past the first cairn, with one path going to Cliff and the other to Redfield. A second cairn indicates the split. From the second cairn, the short but strenuous climb to Cliff's summit can be extremely muddy, and features difficult sections of rock and cliffs. It's generally thought that the views from Redfield are superior to those from Cliff."
